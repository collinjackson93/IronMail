## Development Guidelines
- Code in the master branch must be functional and pass all tests. If a feature can be finished in a commit or two, it can be added directly to the master branch. Otherwise, create a new branch to develop the feature in.
- If you develop a feature, make sure there is ample test coverage for it before moving onto a new feature. Ideally, tests would be created prior to merging into master, but it is not a necessity.
- Use good naming conventions and break complex functions down into smaller functions that are easier to test.
